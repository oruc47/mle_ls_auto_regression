# mle_ls_auto_regression
Analysis of the finite sample behavior of estimators and tests of regression models with AR disturbances, where Least Squares (LS) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation and inference are examined. Empirical behavior of the statistics in finite samples are analyzed using Monte Carlo simulation under standard and nonstandard conditions.
